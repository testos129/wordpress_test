== Description ==
Start with a solid foundation of the Twenty Fifteen WordPress theme that is blog-focused, and designed for clarity and straightforward simplicity. Now offer a child theme called Speculate to create design and visual enhancements for a more refined feel. We've maintained the exceptional core features and functions of Twenty Fifteen, while making several font adjustments. We also made adjustments to sidebar and main content areas, added a new banner sidebar position, added a new colour style option, customized the social icon menu, and several other refinements that will stand out to be a much cleaner style.

* Mobile-first, Responsive Layout
